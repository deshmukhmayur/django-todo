# Django Todo

## Introduction

Todo is a simple Django app for a basic todo list.
It provides basic task adding, marking, and removing functionality.

## Usage

The web app provides a simple easy to use interface for a todo list. New items can be added using the input textbox at the top, and the completed items can be checked off using the checkbox to the left of each item in the list.
To delete an item from the list, just hover over the item, and click on the (x) to the right of the item.

## Contributing

This project is not, by any means, complete. This app was meant as a basic follow up tutorial for AngularJS and Django. I just wanted to see how it works out. One can find possibly many flaws in it. Or even missing features.
